# Geo Snacks 2.0

## Purpose
In my journey back through redoing my bootcamp assignments I have arrived at the first group project. Obviously since I am on this journey alone I did not have a group. In my bootcamp I was able to work with three other students and I was provided help from my instructors. This time I was able to successfully recreate the app my group originally intended in the bootcamp. Even though I was not set to a specific deadline this time around I finished the project easily with really only about 8 total hours of working time. The project was meant to help students utilize more than one API and create a useful functioning site. While I was proud of my groups first attempt at the idea there were a number of features I really wanted to play around with had we been given more time. I took alot of lessons from the first project and implemented them this time around. I remember not utilizing JQuery to render dom elements as well as I should have and as a result the page looked sloppy and unplanned. I ended up writting way more HTML in the first time around and I utilized multiple html and js files. I also wanted to make this page responsive this time around. 

## Process
One major difference I mentioned before is in the process of rendering the elements. The first attempt I tended to hardcode more html and use the ajax return to fill in the information in the elements. This provided a problem when for instance, I would have six result cards hard coded but only three results returned in an array. As a result there were cards with place holder information showing and it didnt look good. This time everything was rendered by the by JQuery and it works successfully. I am really pround of myself for being able to implement this along with making the site responsive with both a desk top and mobile application.
